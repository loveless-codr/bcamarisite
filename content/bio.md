_black trans enby rapper from the USA; based out of PDX. shoegazy, sometimes ambient trap/drill-esque vibes. cloud rap energy. been working since \~2014._

I was raised in NYC and absorbed New England and Caribbean culture from my parents; recently, this has turned my ear towards UK drill, Afrobeats, and music from all over the diaspora.

I'm a major fan of dub, ambient, sleep, tea, being alone, and spending time in-person with my close ones.

I was around when cloud rap was coming into prominence with Lil B, Xaiver Wulf, and Yung Lean; I fell in love with the sound and its been a major influence on my approach to music and writing since. I love writing. much of my focus falls there when making work.

graphic design, videography, producing, songwriting, and journaling are some of my passions. i'm a lover of anticolonial literature and work.
