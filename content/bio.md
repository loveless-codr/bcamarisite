_black trans rapper from the USA; based out of PDX. been working since \~2014._

raised in nyc, afrocaribbean. i'm always looking to expand my palette of black music. right now i'm exploring trinibad and bimhall, but amapiano, kompa, afrobeats, and dancehall are heavy in my rotation as well.

i have a radio show called "chant babylon down" that I post weekly.

i am also a graphic designer and writer.
