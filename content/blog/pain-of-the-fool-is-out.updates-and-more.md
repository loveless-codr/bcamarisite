hello hello. read on.

_growing older with this project has been challenging and sometimes invigorating. i wonder about how to connect my different eras or be kind to them. i think bitter camari is separate from me but it follows me; we are on parallel paths._

_i’ve lately felt the need to withdraw and look at her with more detail. is she doing what i need her to do? for me? am i asking the right questions? giving her the challenges she needs to grow?_

_so i’ve withdrawn. bandcamp is a nice platform but all of my new releases will up here, on my website. i may put some of my old work up there but it will be more expensive than if you bought them from here and without any additional trinkets or gifts i might send you with your purchase. i want to show more sides of this project than only the music and lyrics. i haven’t gotten to really explore those._

_i want a more precise project, something i can walk myself through like a mind map. “my bed goes here. this is my cup.” and so on._

_i want it to feel good; more sensory information, more worldly and tactile._

i wrote all of that above before I finished 'pain of the fool'. this is me writing now about 3 weeks after its release. it is a hot summer day in Portland. i am locked away inside my apartment, not really looking at my phone but aware that my loved ones are reaching out to me and saying nice things. i sometimes come to bitter camari when i want to step away from my life or try better to understand it. now is both of those times.

i feel very good about pain of the fool. it feels like my most calculated and mature record yet, musically. i really spent a lot of time making sure the composition, arrangement, and mixing was as good as i could get it before releasing it. i don't usually do that. i like to move fast so that i can explore a lot of different sounds and ideas and then later come back and sift through what i created. but i think i'm coming to a point with this project that i want more from myself.

i really want to take bitter camari on tour. i stayed in new york for a bit last year and got to perform for audiences there. the reaction was not what i was expecting. some people really loved it. some rooms were completely silent after trans supremacy. i guess that is to be expected. but i remember being confused and a bit hurt then. i want to know more, though. how could i grow and who could i meet?

i also want to do more digital artwork. i've mostly done all of the covers for my albums, and i think they are nice, but i want to be in galleries. i want to paint scenes. visual work can sometimes tell different stories than sound can. i wonder how my work would be received in the caribbean.

i'd like to take bitter camari outside of hip hop more, too. maybe you will someday hear a bachata album. or an ambient one. or an ambient bachata album. i'm thinking.

anyways, thanks for reading. i'm going to release a deluxe version of pain of the fool i think. and then onto something different!

_P.S. the bandcamp is no more. if you purchased an album, you should still have access to download copies of them. if you don't, email me at bittercamari@gmail.com and i will send them to you._

love
