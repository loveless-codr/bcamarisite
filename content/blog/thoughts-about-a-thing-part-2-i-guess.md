sometimes I feel unsure of how to process a lot of things happening at once. I get overwhelmed and wait until its been long enough to forget about what happened. it is easier to wait for an understanding to come to me than it is to look for it. im sure this isn't healthy, but it feels honest that I'm saying it, at least.

I like to think about being black in this city, but I don't want to be vicariously consumed for that. most people in this city don't interact with black people directly and often. the internet, memes, and music probably make upmost of what they know. this is really strange because I often hear people from here who sound 'blacker' than me. like they are from places I've been in years past, very far away.

so, often when I meet for the first time, it takes time to hear how they really talk. the way they texted me doesn't sound the way they speak to the me they've actually met.

naming this may be met with quiet bitterness or stoic arrogance. sentences with a lot of punctuation. a sudden change in temperature. averted eye contact. an understanding broken.

i've been here for a few years; I've seen northeast transform all its black people into murals and condos. we all know what the history of this place is, even those that don't know what the history of this place is. this is not a place where black people have ever been wanted, except to benefit how people feel about themselves.
