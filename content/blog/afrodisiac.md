hi! couple things happening in my life:

\- recovering from covid

\- 11/12 show canceled

\- new album?

i'm a little confused right now; mentally and physically recovering from COVID. feeling a bit sloppy and shaky. I just got TIDAL so I'm also getting back into listening to a lot of music. which leads me to The Veldt's _Afrodisiac_.

I **love** this album.

A lot of shoegaze feels like drawn out American Football. I've gotten tired of Slowdive. It still slaps, but I'd fall asleep if I listened to it driving. The Veldt feels firmer and colorful. I want to sing along. Check out this [zany upload someone did of their song _Until You're Forever_.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYxhQlch7ZM)

Listen to Daniel Chavis's fucking vocals. He has so much personality and volume, it feels like he's dancing with the instrumental when he sings.

[Oh, wait..](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfw6KIFeGSc)

[That's because he is.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfw6KIFeGSc)

Yeah, check this album out. I love the Veldt. Thanks to @snaughty for putting me onto them.
